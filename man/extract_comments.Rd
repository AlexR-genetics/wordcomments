\description{
Extracts all comments from a Microsoft Word (.docx) document, including
metadata such as author, date, position, resolution status, and thread
information.
}
\details{
The function parses the internal XML structure of Word documents to extract
comment data. Line numbers refer to paragraph positions since Word doesn't
store true line numbers. Page numbers are estimated based on paragraph count
(~25 paragraphs per page).

Comments are returned sorted by position (Line) then by date.

\dontrun{
# Extract all comments
comments <- extract_comments("manuscript.docx")

# Extract only unresolved comments
open_comments <- extract_comments("manuscript.docx", include_resolved = FALSE)
}
