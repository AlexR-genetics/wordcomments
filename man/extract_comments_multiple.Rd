\title{Extract and merge comments from multiple document versions}
\usage{
extract_comments_multiple(
  docx_paths,
  include_resolved = TRUE,
  add_source = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{docx_paths}{Character vector of paths to .docx files}

\item{include_resolved}{Logical. If TRUE (default), includes resolved comments.
If FALSE, only returns unresolved comments.}

\item{add_source}{Logical. If TRUE, adds a Source column indicating which
document each comment came from. Default FALSE for compatibility with
other functions.}
}
\value{
A data frame with the same structure as \code{\link{extract_comments}}:
\describe{
\item{Text}{The text that was commented on}
\item{Comment}{The comment content}
\item{Author}{Comment author name}
\item{Date}{Date and time the comment was made}
\item{Line}{Paragraph number in document}
\item{Page}{Estimated page number}
\item{Resolved}{Logical indicating if comment thread is resolved}
\item{comment_id}{Internal comment ID (renumbered to avoid conflicts)}
\item{para_id}{Paragraph ID for thread matching (renumbered)}
\item{parent_id}{Parent paragraph ID for replies (renumbered)}
\item{Source}{(Optional) Source document filename, if add_source = TRUE}
}
}
\description{
Extracts comments from multiple versions of a document (or related documents)
and merges them into a single data frame. Comment IDs are renumbered to avoid
conflicts. The output format is identical to \code{\link{extract_comments}},
making it compatible with all other wordcomments functions.
}
\details{
This function is useful when you have multiple reviewers working on separate
copies of a document and you want to consolidate all their comments.

Comments are sorted by Line (position) then by Date, regardless of which
document they came from. This gives a unified view of all feedback organized
by where it appears in the document.

Since comment IDs are renumbered, thread relationships (replies) are preserved
within each document but not across documents.

\dontrun{
# Extract comments from multiple reviewer versions
all_comments <- extract_comments_multiple(
  c("manuscript_reviewer1.docx",
    "manuscript_reviewer2.docx",
    "manuscript_editor.docx")
)

# Use with other wordcomments functions
comment_summary(all_comments)
comments_by_reviewer(all_comments, split = TRUE)
generate_response_table(all_comments, "consolidated_response.xlsx")

# Include source document info
all_comments <- extract_comments_multiple(
  c("reviewer1.docx", "reviewer2.docx"),
  add_source = TRUE
)
table(all_comments$Source)  # See comment counts per document
}
